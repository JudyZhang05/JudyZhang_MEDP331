            <h1>Chapter I - My Reading Addiction</h1>
            <small><i>"A reader lives a thousand lives before they die . . . Those who never read lives only one" - George R.R. Martin</i></small>
            <h4>How It Began</h4>
            <p>My first book that got me addicted was borrowed to me by my brother. The book was
                a recount of the atrocities committed in WW2 and it's painful aftermath, which has scarred an entire nation
                and left it in shambles. I didn't quite expect to enjoy the book as much as I had. Additonally,
                the speed in which I had completed the book in has shocked and motivated me to read more. 
            </p>
            <h4>It's a Lifestyle</h4>
            <p>Reading has by far been the one entertainment that I have enjoyed most in. Each turn of a page
                brings a new journey and adventure.
            </p>
            <p>I still consider myself a beginner when it comes to reading, I have only dipped my toe 
                in the world of books and am always on the lookout to read more and explore other genres.

                <h4>Self Control</h4>
                <p>Some tips on when you start reading. Have some self control. Don't be like me. See a new book + immediate purchase of entire series + 
                    prioritize reading over daily necessities + unhealthy. Don't enhale the entire book in one sitting. What are you? A sociopath? Savor the book
                    , let the plot sit and stir you randomly throughout the day. That's the beauty in reading, it should be a prolonged mystery as to what will
                    happen next.
